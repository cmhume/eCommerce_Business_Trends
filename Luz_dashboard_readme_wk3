# The Dashboard
This report starts by telling the story of Olist, how they began, where there customers are at, what products sell the most and 
ways to improve their services. Olist is a company that begins its online presence in the Fall of 2016 and builds a robust presence 
in 2017 and 2018. We review the products that they help distribute and how they're performing around the country. As part of their 
quality control review they send out surveys for feedback on their services, we were able to use their star rating to see how customers
felt about the services provided. Finally part of the service Olist provides is logistics and delivery is largely discussed in these
reviews, we attempt to draw this picture in our visualizations.

## Visualization Tools
The team decided to move forward with Tableau for our dashboard needs. The data, as previously described, was cleaned, merged and 
further processed via Python, postgresSQL, and AWS. The dataset that we've been working with include some of the changes made for 
the machine learning models, changing strings into integers. Also, in assistance to our Tableau learning journey, aside from the 
module, were youtube videos for guidance on connecting worksheets for interactive connections and overlapping maps to demonstrate
the data. 

## Sales Dashboard

In this board we see the popularity of items being sold on Olist, most popular item are home goods and least popular are security
services. We used cluster or bubble chart to review this and a map to locate places where these items were sold most frequently. 

## Review Dashboard

The next dashboard illustrates the reviews and how most categories were rated. Overall Olist provides a good service with most 
items receiving reviews of 3.5 and greater. There are negative reviews and there will be seen in areas where delivering large ticket
items may not be as easy as delivering smaller items. Most of our machine learning visualizations and results are located in this frame
as well. The logistics might be different. For this reason we also reviewed freight costs and services.
