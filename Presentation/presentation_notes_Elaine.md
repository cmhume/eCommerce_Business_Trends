For our selected topic, we…
- we performed an analysis of the orders placed from 2016-2018
- and with our data we created machine learning models to predict review scores
AND the reason we chose this topic because…
- This dataset has a range of information available and it has the potential to make predictions with machine learning models.
- This dataset also gave us the opportunity to use SQL joins to create new tables WHERE we joined it on a postgres server
- the data was ALSO easily downloaded from kaggle


*   **Description of the source of data:** mention product category name translation table and need to translate names into English

- here are the 9 csv data files that we used postgres to create the tables in SQL. You can see the names of the files in the blue part of the boxes
- so first we cleaned these tables by using Jupyter Notebook and then imported them to a postgres server to join the tables THEN created one big database which is shown here
- this ERD is basically showing the relationship of the orders from multiple marketplaces in Brazil from 2016-2018 and how they’re all connected
- we did SQL inner joins to connect all these tables
