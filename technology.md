# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Python and Pandas to explore, document, and perform our data transformation. Further analysis will be completed by doing Machine Learning where we compare the accuracy and make predictions about the customer’s buying trends based on their location.

## Database Storage
We will use SQL with pgAdmin4 to make the tables to display the buying trends from our CSV files. We will also use ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) to design our database…

## Machine Learning
We will be using Tensorflow and SciKitLearn for our machine learning. 
- We will use Tensorflow to handle our huge set of data and build neural networks to make predictions and compare the accuracy of the trends based on the customer’s location and the products customers in that area tend to buy. 
- We will use SciKitLearn to scale our data…

## Dashboard
Later on, we are planning to use Tableau to make visualizations, such as bar graphs and heat maps of our data. Tableau can help make our charts interactive. All of these visualizations will be organized and hosted through a Tableau story which will make it easier for our audience to understand instead of having one big sheet with all of our visualizations mixed together.
