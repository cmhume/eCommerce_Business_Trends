# Group Project
## Presentation
**Selected Topic:** Brazilian eCommerce Business Trends

**Why we selected our topic:** 

We selected this topic because we would like to know the what the consumer online shopping behavior is depending on their geographic location in order to analyze the difference in shopping behaviors depending on a consumer's geographic location. We would also like to know what products would be more in demand depending on the time of year.

**Description of our source of data:**

The datasets shows data about the consumers ordering these products, what type of product they ordered, and the geographic region the consumers are located in.

**Questions we hope to answer with our data:**

With this data, we hope to answer...
- What is the ordering behavior for consumers in each geographical region?
- What type of products would a company expect to buy more of depending on the season?

## Communication Protocol

- **Zoom:** Every Thursday at 7pm to share what we found
- **Google Drive:** To add websites with data, brainstorm topics to choose from, and share our files for the project
