## Presentation
**Selected Topic:** Transmission trends of COVID-19/Coronavirus in the United States

**Reason why we selected our topic:** 

We selected this topic because it's relatable to everyone and the current events going on in the world right now. There are many articles online with charts and other visualizations that talks about the transmission trends of COVID-19 right now, which a lot of people may be interested in. High COVID-19 cases is related to other problems happening in the United States right now, such as unemployment because of the lockdowns.

**Description of our source of data:**

The datasets I chose shows the amount of COVID-19 cases from January 2020 to July 2021 in the United States. It shows the changes in cases when there were mask rules compared to when they got rid of mask rules. This source of data also has visualizations showing the amount of cases during that timeframe.

**Questions we hope to answer with the data:**

With this data, we hope to answer...
- Why certain months and counties? 
- How to help lower COVID-19 transmission rates based on the articles and data?
- If masking vs. not wearing a mask has an affect on transmission rates.
- What states have the lowest transmission rates?
