### Project Topic


In this project, we will analyze past customer data from an online retailer with the goal of predicting consumer behavior by geographic region using machine learning.  We chose the [Brazilian-eCommerce](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) dataset from Kaggle for our analysis.  Six files from the original Kaggle dataset were chosen for further analysis: geolocation_dataset, olist_customers_dataset, olist_product_dataset, order_item_dataset, olist_orders_dataset, and product_category_name_translation.   

* Topic 


* Why we selected our topic


* Description of source data


* Questions we hope to answer with our data

### Communication Protocol


* We will coordinate and communicate through Slack and Zoom. Our team will meet on Zoom every Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. 


#### Planning Meeting:


* Every Monday we will meet to plan the deliverables and responsibilities for the entire week. Everyone will work on their branch or feature branch on Github.


#### Debugging Session:


* Every Wednesday we will discuss challenges and try to debug issues together.


#### Merging work to main branch


* We will post on slack before merging to the main branch and after creating new branches.


* Every Thursday we merge work to the main branch for everyone to review and provide feedback. 


* By the end of the week, the person with github responsibilities will submit the deliverable on Canvas.
