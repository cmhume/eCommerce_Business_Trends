### Project Topic


In this project, we will analyze customer orders placed between 2016-2018 from multiple sellers on the eCommerce platform [Olist Store](https://olist.com/).  Our ultimate goal is to predict consumer behavior from this dataset using machine learning algorithms.  We chose the [Brazilian-eCommerce](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) dataset from Kaggle for our analysis.  This dataset contains approximately 100,000 customer orders, along with corresponding files on product information and Portuguese to English tanslations of product categories. Seller names were anonymized in this dataset and replaced with Game of Thrones House names.  Six files from the original Kaggle dataset were chosen for further analysis: geolocation_dataset, olist_customers_dataset, olist_product_dataset, order_item_dataset, olist_orders_dataset, and product_category_name_translation.  We chose this dataset because of the number of datapoints it contained, and the analysis options the dataset provided us with multiple files and types of data. From this data, we will first determine the number of customers by geographic region (looking at zipcode prefix, city, and state), most popular products, product sales by geographic region, number of repeat customers and repeat purchases, and sales by date.  After datacleaning and initial analysis, we will use machine learning to make predictions on customer behavior, providing sellers on Olist the opportunity to increase sales and their customer base.

### Communication Protocol


* We will coordinate and communicate through Slack and Zoom. Our team will meet on Zoom every Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. 


#### Planning Meeting:


* Every Monday we will meet to plan the deliverables and responsibilities for the entire week. Everyone will work on their branch or feature branch on Github.


#### Debugging Session:


* Every Wednesday we will discuss challenges and try to debug issues together.


#### Merging work to main branch


* We will post on slack before merging to the main branch and after creating new branches.


* Every Thursday we will merge work to the main branch for everyone to review and provide feedback. 


* On Sundays at 7pm, we will check in on Slack to review our github page before turning in the assignment on Canvas.  


## Machine Learning


We plan on trying a variety of machine learning models on our database and choosing the best performing model for our final analysis.
